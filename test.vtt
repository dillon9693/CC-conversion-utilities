What are key principles for student-centered learning?

0:00:04.02 --> 0:00:10.00
MindEdge has identified seven principles for improved student outcomes.

0:00:10.02 --> 0:00:13.00
1. Place the student at the center of the learning experience. 

0:00:13.02 --> 0:00:19.00
Focus on supporting and empowering the student in master- ing the skills and knowledge in a given field of study. 

0:00:19.02 --> 0:00:26.00
Shift from the traditional "sage on the stage" approach for instructors to one built around coaching and advising. 

0:00:26.02 --> 0:00:33.00
Students who are engaged, learn. Students who are challenged by interesting learning experiences, learn. 

0:00:33.02 --> 0:00:39.00
2. Leverage existing knowledge and skills. Today's students often have prior subject knowledge.

0:00:39.02 --> 0:00:44.00
Whenever possible capitalize on this foundation, valuing and extending it.

0:00:44.02 --> 0:00:47.00
3. Respect the learner's time. 

0:00:47.02 --> 0:00:51.00
A well-constructed learning experience lets students know what is expected of them, 

0:00:51.02 --> 0:00:57.00
and focuses assignments and assessments on the learning objectives outlined at the start of the course. 

0:00:57.02 --> 0:01:03.00
Time is precious -- avoid the extraneous or off-topic.  Let students learn at their own pace.

0:01:03.02 --> 0:01:09.00
4. Employ diagnostic assessments to ascertain gaps in knowledge.

0:01:09.02 --> 0:01:15.00
Assessing prior student knowledge, and identifying gaps, is a key. Diagnostic assessments can determine what 

0:01:15.02 --> 0:01:19.00
should be emphasized, and what can be given a more cursory review.

0:01:19.02 --> 0:01:23.00
5. Offer varied learning experiences. 

0:01:23.02 --> 0:01:30.00
Variety matters: it keeps learners engaged. Offer numerous ways for students to learn -- including video, audio,

0:01:30.02 --> 0:01:35.00
infographics, interactives, assessments, and games. 

0:01:35.02 --> 0:01:42.00
6. Provide needed scaffolding and practice for learners. Not everyone "gets it" immediately, so offer deeper levels

0:01:42.02 --> 0:01:45.00
of instruction for students who may struggle with new concepts.

0:01:45.02 --> 0:01:51.00
Whole-Part-Whole learning and adaptive learning are ways to integrate scaffolding and support into instruction. 

0:01:51.02 --> 0:01:55.00
7. Measure progress and mastery of learning objectives. 

0:01:55.02 --> 0:02:02.00
At every phase of learning, assess student progress. Ask students to demonstrate their mastery of material by

0:02:02.02 --> 0:02:05.00
synthesizing answers to higher-order questions.

0:02:05.02 --> 0:02:11.00
These seven principles can be applied in all forms of learning -- classroom, blended, and online --

0:02:11.02 --> 0:02:15.00
and can provide a useful framework for developing and designing effective learning experiences.
