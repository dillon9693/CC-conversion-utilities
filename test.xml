<p begin="0:00:13.02" end="0:00:19.00" class="hide_from_transcript">Focus on supporting and empowering the student in master- ing the skills and knowledge in a given field of study. </p>

<p begin="0:00:26.02" end="0:00:33.00" class="hide_from_transcript">Students who are engaged, learn. Students who are challenged by interesting learning experiences, learn. </p>
